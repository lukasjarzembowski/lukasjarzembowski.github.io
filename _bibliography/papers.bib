  abstract  = "Store-operated Ca2+-entry (SOCE) regulates basal and
               receptor-triggered Ca2+ signaling with STIM proteins sensing the
               endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ content and triggering Ca2+
               entry by gating Orai channels. Although crucial for immune
               cells, STIM1's role in neuronal Ca2+ homeostasis is
               controversial. Here, we characterize a splice variant, STIM1B,
               which shows exclusive neuronal expression and protein content
               surpassing conventional STIM1 in cerebellum and of significant
               abundance in other brain regions. STIM1B expression results in a
               truncated protein with slower kinetics of ER-plasma membrane
               (PM) cluster formation and ICRAC, as well as reduced
               inactivation. In primary wild-type neurons, STIM1B is targeted
               by its spliced-in domain B to presynaptic sites where it
               converts classic synaptic depression into Ca2+- and
               Orai-dependent short-term synaptic enhancement (STE) at
               high-frequency stimulation (HFS). In conjunction with altered
               STIM1 splicing in human Alzheimer disease, our findings
               highlight STIM1 splicing as an important regulator of neuronal
               calcium homeostasis and of synaptic plasticity.",
